Introduction<br>
spsim is a small program which aims to realistically simulate the output of a single particle diffraction<br>
experiment. The program reads it's input from a single file named spsim.conf which must reside<br>
on the directory where the program is run. It then runs for while and produces several VTK files<br>
related to the detector output from the simualted an experiment.<br>
1.1<br>
spsim.conf<br>
spsim.conf is composed of several "key = value lines;". All lines starting with "#" are comments<br>
and not interpreted by the program. All values are in SI units!<br>
The required keys are:<br>
· number of dimensions = &lt;int&gt; - currently only the value of 2 is valid. Number of dimensions<br>
of the output.<br>
· input type = &lt;string&gt; - currently only the value "pdb" is accepted. Defines the type of the<br>
input structure on which the experiment is going to be performed.<br>
· pdb filename = &lt;string&gt; - a string containing the path to the PDB file to be used.<br>
· detector distance = &lt;float&gt; - the distance to the detectorin meters.<br>
· detector width = &lt;float&gt; - the width of the detectorin meters.<br>
· detector height = &lt;float&gt; - the height of the detectorin meters.<br>
· detector pixel width = &lt;float&gt; - the width of a single pixelin meters.<br>
· detector pixel height = &lt;float&gt; - the height of a single pixelin meters.<br>
· detector quantum efficiency = &lt;float&gt; - the quantum efficiency of the detector. A number<br>
from [0.00,1.00] indicating 0 to 100% efficiency<br>

· detector electron hole production energy = &lt;float&gt; - energy required to produce an electron<br>
on the detectorin joules.<br>
· detector readout noise = &lt;float&gt; - RMS of the readout noise, in electrons per pixel.<br>
· detector dark current = &lt;float&gt; - dark current of the CCD in electrons/(pixel.second).<br>
· detector linear full well = &lt;float&gt; - maximum capacity of a pixel in electrons.<br>
· detector binning &lt;int&gt; - number of pixels to bin. Binning is assumed to be the same in all<br>
dimensions so a value of 4 means 4x4 binning.<br>
· detector maximum value = &lt;float&gt; maximum value that the detector output. For a 16 bit<br>
detector this would be 216 or 65535.0.<br>
· experiment wavelength = &lt;float&gt; the wavelength of the experiment in meters.<br>
· experiment exposure time = &lt;float&gt; total exposure time in seconds.<br>
· experiment beam intensity = &lt;float&gt; total beam intensity integrated over the entire exposure<br>
time in photons/m2.<br>
Due to the way libconfig works all floating point values must include a decimal point, otherwise<br>
they will be treated as 0. So for example if your detector readout noise is 10 you need to write<br>
"detector readout noise = 10.0;".<br>
Here is an example configuration file:<br>
number_of_dimensions = 2;<br>
input_type = &quot;pdb&quot;;<br>
pdb_filename = &quot;DNA_triangle.pdb&quot;;<br>
# 5cm detector distance<br>

#20um square pixels<br>
detector_pixel_width = 2.000000e-05;<br>
detector_pixel_height = 2.000000e-05;<br>

Output<br>
The output of spsim consists of the following files:<br>
· spsim.confout - contains all information read by the program from spsim.conf<br>
· scattering factor.vtk - the scattering factors of the input molecule on the detector<br>
· thomson correction.vtk - the thomson correction factor for each pixel. Simply the differential<br>
electron cross-section times the pixel solid-angle<br>
· solid angle.vtk - the solid angle for each pixel<br>
· photon count.vtk - the number of photons detected by each pixel. This already takes into<br>
account the quantum efficiency and poisson noise.<br>
· electrons per pixel.vtk - electrons generated on each pixel due to the incomming photons.<br>
· real output.vtk - the value that detector output, including all the noise effects.<br>
· noiseless output.vtk - the value which the detector would output if there were no sources of<br>
noise.<br>
An easy way to examine images is to use an excellent visualizer called VisIt produced by the LLNL<br>
and freely available for many platforms. Please visit the page http://www.llnl.gov/visit/ for more<br>
information, including installation details. From now on i'll assume that you have VisIt installed.<br>
But any other VTK visualizer like should work.<br>

Theory<br>
The way spsim simulates the diffraction patterns is very simple. First it starts by calculating the<br>
reciprocal space coordinates of the detector pixels, using the Ewald sphere construct [1]. For each<br>
pixel x, y on the detector at a distance d from the source and at a wavelength  the reciprocal h, k, l<br>
coordinates are:<br>
x<br>
y<br>

Then the molecular scattering factors are calculated on those coordinates, using CCP4's atomsf.lib<br>
to get the atomic scattering factors. Assuming n atoms at positions (xj, yj, zj) and using ai,bi and<br>
c from atomsf.lib.<br>

After that the Thomson correction is applied. K1 and K2 are the relative vertical and horizontal<br>
polarized parts of the beam. That an horizontal scaterring plane K1 = 0 and K2 = 1 and vice<br>
versa. For unpolarized light K1 = K2 = 0.5. P is the polarization factor. 2 is the angle between<br>
the primary beam and the direction of observation. IeT h is the density of the scattered radiation, Ii<br>
is the intensity of the indicent radiation, e is the charge of the electron, m the mass of the electron<br>
and c the speed of light.<br>

is known as the classic electron radius.<br>

The Thomson correction is applied to each pixel according to it's solid angle, and then the total<br>
number of photons that arrive to each pixel is calculated.  is the solid angle and Apx is the pixel<br>
area projected on a plane passing through the center of the pixel and normal to the direction of<br>
observation.<br>

The number of photons that arrive at each pixel, P hinc is then given by:<br>
P hinc(x, y) = T homson() × (x, y) × F (hkl(x, y)) × Ii<br>
(2.10)<br>
From those pixel that arrive at each pixel only a certain number is detected. The percentage that<br>
on average is detected is known as quantum efficiency( ) and is wavelength dependent. P oisson(x)<br>
returns a poisson distributed number with mean x. The number of photons detected on each<br>
pixel(P hdet) is then:<br>
P hdet(x, y) = P oisson(P hinc(x, y) ×  )<br>
(2.11)<br>
Using µ to represent the energy to produce one electron hole, the number of electrons generated on<br>
the pixel by the detected photons(elgen is then simply:<br>
P hdet(x, y) × hc<br>

<br>

Representing the maximum value output by the detector by Vmax, the binned pixels by pxbin, the<br>
pixel linear full well by Wmax exposure time by t dark current by  and readout noise by N , the<br>
final output is then calculated by:<br>

Where Gaussian(x) returns a normally distributed random number with mean 0 and standard<br>

Installation<br>
spsim should compile in any linux distribution and most kinds of Unix. It might also compile in<br>
windows under cygwin although that has not been tested.<br>
To install first simply extract the source code, go to the libconfig-0.9 directory inside of the source<br>
code directory, run configure followed by make, move to the previous directory and run make. For<br>
example:<br>
$ tar -zxvf spsim-1.0.tar.gz<br>
$ cd spsim-1.0<br>
$ cd libconfig-0.9<br>
$ ./configure<br>
$ make<br>
$ cd ..<br>
$ make<br>
You now should have a binary called "spsim" in your "spsim-1.0" directory, ready to run.<br>
If you wish to turn off MPI support you need to edit the Makefile on the "spsim-1.0" directory and<br>
change the MPI = ON line to MPI = OFF.<br>

You can now run the examples by going to the examples directory and running spsim:<br>
$ cd examples<br>
$ ../spsim<br>
This should produce several files including "real output.vtk" and "noiseless output.vtk" that you<br>
can now take a look at. They should look like this:<br>
Congratulations you have successfully installed spsim!<br>
